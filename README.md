## What is PowerRanks?
PowerRanks is a rank-based permission management plugin for your Minecraft server.

It allows server managers to set-up ranks that can control what player can and cannot do.

Each individual player on a server can have one or more ranks with each a different set of permissions.

Permission priority on ranks is controlled by the ranks weight, the higher the weight, the more important it is.

## Why PowerRanks?
* **Fast** - made with performance and big data in mind
* **Easy to use** - made to be easy to set-up with commands or the webeditor
* **Reliable** - trusted by many and PowerRanks can correct itself when something goes wrong
* **Customizable** - with many customization options in the core you can shape PowerRanks to fit your servers needs
* **Free** - free to use for all your servers
